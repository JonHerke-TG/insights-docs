= Overview

TigerGraph Insights is a no-code visual graph analyzer that makes building data analytics dashboards intuitive.

Insights offers a way to create responsive and interactive demos for displaying graph information to a general audience and
non-technical users can quickly and easily obtain meaningful visual insights that would remain hidden without a deep graph-enabled analysis of their connected data.
