= Overview

TigerGraph Insights is a no-code visual graph analyzer that makes building data analytics dashboards intuitive.
Non-technical users can quickly and easily obtain meaningful visual insights that would remain hidden without a deep graph-enabled analysis of their connected data.

//[NOTE]
//This release of TigerGraph Insights is a preview meant for early learning and experimentation with new features.
