= Applications
:experimental:

Applications are the backbone of TigerGraph Insights. Each application has pages, which themselves have xref:widgets:index.adoc[] that display information from a TigerGraph instance.

You can think of an application as a binder in a physical presentation. Binders have sections, which correspond to pages in Insights, and widgets are more advanced, interactive versions of charts and figures in a presentation.

== Create an application

You can create a maximum of 150 applications per TigerGraph instance.

On the main TigerGraph Insights page, click btn:[+ New Application].

image::new-application-button.png[]

In the next window, choose a name, icon, and default graph to pull data from.
All of these options can be changed later as well.

If you don't see any graphs in the dropdown list, either there are no graphs on your instance or you do not have permissions to view any graphs.
Try creating a new graph using xref:gui:graphstudio:overview.adoc[GraphStudio] first, or contact an administrator to grant you the correct permissions.

Your new application will appear on the Insights main page under My Applications. If other users on the same TigerGraph instance have created their own applications, they will be listed under "Other Applications."

=== Preview an application

Preview mode is designed to show off the use of your application in a presentation.
In preview mode, the UI is minimized and all pages and widgets are locked with no changes possible.

Save the application and press the play button to enter preview mode.
The preview button is inactive (greyed out) until the application is saved.

=== Modify an application

You can edit, duplicate, and delete applications from the same main page by clicking the three-dot menu.

Click btn:[Settings] to update the name, icon, and default graph just as if you were creating the application for the first time.
Duplicating an application is useful for quickly trying out new options while still being able to refer back to the previoous configuration.

=== Share an application

==== Share via login
* Click on btn:[Share] in the three-dot menu to bring up the Share window.

* Select one of the listed users.

==== Share via access token

If you want to share your widget with a user who does not have an Insights login, you can send them an access token.

==== Creating database account

You will need a separate database account to generate an access token for Insights.
Ensure that you grant minimal privileges to this account.

Please check the xref:tigergraph-server:reference:list-of-privileges.adoc[].

TigerGraph provides two modes for running queries:

* Run a previously **Installed** query
* **Interpret** an ad hoc query

For Insights, **Interpret** query is the default query mode, unless you explicitly convert it to an **Installed** query.
If your widget only needs pre-designed queries, then you may only need **installed** queries.
If you want users to be able to create and run their own queries, then likely they will need to be able to **interpret** queries.

==== Query permissions required to write/run queries.

`WRITE_QUERY` privilege is required to interpret queries or to install queries.
It is not needed to run an installed query.

`READ_DATA` privilege is required for any type of query, and you can grant it at various levels.
(Details are provided in xref:gui:admin-portal:management/user-management.adoc[local privileges])

`READ_SCHEMA` and `READ_QUERY` are also needed for any type of query.

.The minimal required privileges for different types of queries:
[cols='2']
|===
| Query Type | Minimal Required Privileges

| Installed Query | `READ_DATA` ,`READ_SCHEMA`, `READ_QUERY`
| Interpret Query | `READ_DATA` ,`READ_SCHEMA` ,`READ_QUERY`, `WRITE_QUERY`
|===

==== (Optional) Config nginx

This is only needed if you want to embed Insights into third party webpages.

* Switch to the Admin Portal tool to configure `nginx`.
* Set the `content-security-policy` parameter as below, substituting in your web page's URL.

[source, console]
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://www.thirdparty.com;

==== Generating access token

Use the account you just created to generate an access token.
The access token is inside a URL that can be embedded on a page as an iframe into a dashboard.

* Go to `Application > Settings` in the three-dot menu of the specific application.

* On the application page choose the gear icon for `Settings`.

image::appliactionpage2security2.png[]

* Go to the `Security` tab to create the access token.

image::secuirtyPage.png[]

* Click btn:[Generate new token] button and fill in the username/password details.

==== Get the shared link for whole application

We also provide a standalone application URL based on the access token.

* Go back to `Application` page

image::appliactionpage2security2.png[]

* Click `Share`

image::applicationShare.png[]

* And you can copy the URL token from here.

==== Obtaining widget sharing link

* On the application page. Go to the individual widget and click the three dots.

image::WidgetShare.png[]

* Go to `Share` to obtain the sharing link for the specific widget.

=== Backup and restore

Inside the application menu, use another three-dot menu in the upper-right near the Save and Run icons.

image::download-upload-application.png[]

These buttons export or import the application panel in JSON format. If you delete an application, you cannot recover it from the TigerGraph system.
You must use the Download and Upload features to create and restore any backups.
