=== Sorting and grouping

Customize the category (the name of each bar) and one or more numeric values to display in each category.

Sort the data by the category name (alphabetical left to right) or value (increasing left to right).

Group data to combine vertices with the same category name.

Aggregate data with `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MAX`, and `MIN` functions.

=== Display options

You have several options to control the design of the X and Y axis labels of the graph, as well as turn on and off a key that explains each color present.
