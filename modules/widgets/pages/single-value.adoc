If there are multiple `PRINT` statements, users can map multiple print valuesï¼š

[source, gsql]
----
INTERPRET QUERY() FOR GRAPH MyGraph {
    PRINT "demo1";
    PRINT "demo2";
    PRINT "demo3";
}

If the multiple values are printed using `PRINT` and they include vertices or edges, only the value of the first attribute of the vertex or edge can be mapped.

[source, gsql]
----
INTERPRET QUERY() FOR GRAPH MyGraph {
    start = {City.*};
    start = SELECT c FROM City:c;
    PRINT start;
    PRINT "demo1";
}
