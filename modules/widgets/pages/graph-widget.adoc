= Graph Widget
:experimental:

The Graph widget is very similar to the graph visualizer tool in GraphStudio.
It allows you to display the relationships between vertices in a single widget based on a specified query.

You can also run GSQL queries in this graph window.
Please note that the queries are all run in interpreted mode,
xref:gsql-ref:appendix:interpreted-gsql-limitations.adoc[in which not all GSQL query features are available.]

== Inputs

Accepts data as vertices and edges.

== Widget window

=== View details

The tools on the left menu allow you to examine a single vertex or edge in detail.
With the vertex or edge selected, these buttons have the following functions, from top to bottom:

* Show graph nodes/edges information in tabular format.
Click on any node or edge and the viewport will center on it.
* Run a graph algorithm (see the <<graph-algorithms>> section).
* Save the current graph view to your computer as an image.

=== Filter

The bottom left icon brings up a filter menu that allows you to filter the displayed results by different qualities of the vertex or edge.

In this example, we create a filter to only show edges with amounts between -500 and 500.

After the filter is applied, edges that have transfer amounts over 500 are reduced in visibility.
No data is removed from the graph.

=== Change graph view

The tools on the bottom right have the following functions from left to right:

* Zoom in
* Zoom out
* Fit graph to view
* Change graph layout

To save display space, some vertices have a small red number next to them.
Double-click to expand them and reveal the full set of vertices.

=== Undo

The Undo/Redo buttons are in the top right of the graph window.
All history is recorded since opening the graph widget.

== Pathfinding

TigerGraph Insights includes a simple way to run pathfinding detection algorithms without writing a single query.

Click on a vertex to select it, then hold kbd:[Shift] and select another one.

Right-click on either selected vertex and choose btn:[Pathfinding].
You can choose to show one shortest path or all shortest paths.

== Graph algorithms

The Graph widget integrates some of the xref:graph-ml:intro:[Graph Data Science Library algorithms].

The following algorithms are supported:

=== xref:graph-ml:centrality-algorithms:pagerank.adoc[PageRank]

Use PageRank to determine which vertices have the most influence in the graph.
When the algorithm finishes, more influential vertices appear larger.

=== xref:graph-ml:community-algorithms:louvain.adoc[Louvain]

Use Louvain to determine which vertices belong to different communities.
When the algorithm finishes, the vertices are color-coded by community.
